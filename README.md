# autotestingMocha

### Today in chapter "Automated testing with Mocha",  Ilya Kantor JS book, got to know the basic concepts like BDD, spec, assert, describe and it. 

### Although, following a thorow reading of the chapter, did not get most out of it.

### I'm glad, at least I can "hardly", yet steadily, follow the testing structure and understand what's happening, at least at the surface (5% out of 100%).
